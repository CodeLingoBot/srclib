## Srclib Goals

The srclib project aims to provide the following functionality in a language agnostic fashion:

1. Jump to definition support, both within local code bases, as well as across online repositories
2. Given a definition, find examples of its use across open source code
3. Search and find documentation for modules and functions
4. Expose an API that makes it easy to query the results of static analysis
5. Be architected in a way that makes it painless to integrate new languages

To achieve this goal, this document will establish a common format for language-specific analysis tools, so that they can be accessed through a single API.
