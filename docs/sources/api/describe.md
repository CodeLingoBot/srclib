# `src api describe`

The `src api describe` command is used by editor plugins to retrieve information about the identifier at a specific position in a file.

Run `src api describe -h` for a description of how to invoke it.

The output is defined in [api_cmds.go](https://github.com/sourcegraph/srclib/blob/e5295dfcd719535ff9cbb37a2771337d44fe5953/src/api_cmds.go#L190-L193). Run it to see an example.
