<div class="about">
  <div>
    <h1>srclib</h1>
    <br>
    <p>srclib was made in the pursuit of building Sourcegraph, a code search engine
    for developers. Faced with keeping the
    code to ourselves or releasing it to the
    public, we open sourced the entire
    library for the greater developer
    community.</p>

    <p>It is with our purest intensions that we
    hope you use it to make programming
    easier, better, and more insightful.</p>

    <p>Please contact us directly with any
    additional thoughts.</p>
